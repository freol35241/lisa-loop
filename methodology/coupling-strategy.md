# Coupling Strategy

<!-- Defines how subsystems interface with each other.
     Updated during the methodology phase as subsystems are specified. -->

## Coupling Approach

[Overall coupling strategy — sequential, iterative, monolithic, etc.]

## Interface Definitions

<!-- For each subsystem pair that communicates: -->

```
### [Subsystem A] → [Subsystem B]
- **Variables exchanged:** [List with units]
- **Timing:** [When during the solve this exchange happens]
- **Assumptions:** [What each side assumes about the exchanged data]
```

## Dependency Graph

<!-- Textual or ASCII representation of which subsystem depends on which -->

## Convergence

[If iterative coupling: convergence criteria, expected iteration count, fallback]

# Source this file from loop.sh. All variables have defaults;
# uncomment and change only what you need.

# --- Claude Code model selection per phase ---
# Which model to use for each spiral phase.
# Common choices: opus, sonnet, haiku
CLAUDE_MODEL_SCOPE="opus"
CLAUDE_MODEL_REFINE="opus"       # Per-subsystem methodology refinement
CLAUDE_MODEL_BUILD="sonnet"      # Per-subsystem implementation (Ralph loop)
CLAUDE_MODEL_VALIDATE="opus"     # System-level V&V and convergence

# --- Loop limits ---
# Maximum number of spiral passes before stopping (Pass 1..N).
MAX_SPIRAL_PASSES=5

# Maximum Ralph loop iterations per subsystem per spiral pass (build phase).
MAX_RALPH_ITERATIONS=50

# --- Human review ---
# Skip all human review pauses? (true/false)
# When true, the loop runs fully autonomously — use with caution.
NO_PAUSE=false

# --- Git ---
# Skip git push after validation? (true/false)

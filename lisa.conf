# Lisa Loop v2 — Configuration
#
# Source this file from loop.sh. All variables have defaults;
# uncomment and change only what you need.

# --- Claude Code model selection per phase ---
# Which model to use for each spiral phase.
# Common choices: opus, sonnet, haiku
CLAUDE_MODEL_SCOPE="opus"
CLAUDE_MODEL_REFINE="opus"       # Methodology + plan refinement
CLAUDE_MODEL_DDV="opus"          # Domain-Driven Verification (test writing)
CLAUDE_MODEL_BUILD="sonnet"      # Implementation (Ralph loop)
CLAUDE_MODEL_EXECUTE="opus"      # System assembly + execution
CLAUDE_MODEL_VALIDATE="opus"     # System-level V&V and convergence

# --- Loop limits ---
# Maximum number of spiral passes before stopping (Pass 1..N).
MAX_SPIRAL_PASSES=5

# Maximum Ralph loop iterations per spiral pass (build phase).
MAX_RALPH_ITERATIONS=50

# --- Human review ---
# Skip all human review pauses? (true/false)
# When true, the loop runs fully autonomously — use with caution.
NO_PAUSE=false

# --- Git ---
# Skip git push after validation? (true/false)
NO_PUSH=false

# --- Terminal ---
# Collapse agent streaming output after completion? (true/false)
# When true, streaming output (thinking, tool calls) is replaced with a
# one-line summary once the agent finishes; the agent's result text stays.
# When false, all agent output stays visible in the terminal.
COLLAPSE_OUTPUT=true

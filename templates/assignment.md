# Assignment

## Assignment
[Describe what you need solved, built, or analyzed]

## Deliverables
[List the concrete outputs you expect]
- [e.g., Python package with public API]
- [e.g., Technical report as PDF]
- [e.g., Calibrated model parameters]
- [e.g., Dataset in CSV format]

## Deliverable format
[How should deliverables be structured? Any templates, styles, or conventions to follow?]

## Acceptance criteria
[How will you judge the result?]
- [e.g., Predictions within ±5% of published values]
- [e.g., All test cases from Table 3 reproduced]

## Physical phenomena / domain
[What physics, processes, or domain knowledge is involved?]

## References
[List papers, textbooks, or standards you've added to .lisa/references/core/]

## Context
[How will this be used? By whom? What decisions depend on it?]

## Technology Preferences (Optional)

<!-- State your technology preferences here BEFORE running scope.
     If left blank, the scope agent will choose freely based on the problem requirements.
     Examples: "Use Python 3.11+ with NumPy/SciPy", "Must be Rust for performance",
     "Julia 1.10+ for numerical work".
     You may also specify preferred test frameworks, linters, or build tools. -->

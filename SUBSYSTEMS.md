# Subsystems

<!-- Created by the scope phase (Pass 0). Defines the problem decomposition.
     This is the most critical artifact — it determines the structure of all subsequent work.
     Read the decomposition heuristics in PROMPT_scope.md before modifying. -->

## Iteration Order

<!-- Ordered list of subsystems. Approximately topological.
     Exact ordering matters less than getting the general flow right —
     the spiral converges regardless. -->

## Subsystem Definitions

<!-- For each subsystem: what it models, what it provides, what it consumes. -->

## Interface Map

<!-- What quantities flow between subsystems, with units and expected ranges. -->

## Dependency Notes

<!-- Circular dependencies and how the spiral resolves them. -->

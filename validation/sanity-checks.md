# Sanity Checks

<!-- Living document. Initially populated by the scope phase (Pass 0).
     Updated by the ascend phase after each spiral pass with actual results.
     Each check is an engineering judgment test — a failure indicates a likely error. -->

## Format

Each check follows this format:

```
## [Category]
- [ ] [Check description]
  - **Expected:** [What the value should approximately be]
  - **Reasoning:** [Physical justification for why]
  - **Last checked:** [Pass N — PASS/FAIL — actual value]
```

## Order of Magnitude

<!-- Quantities should be approximately the right size. -->

## Expected Trends

<!-- When parameters change, outputs should move in predictable directions. -->

## Physical Bounds

<!-- Outputs must stay within physically possible ranges. -->

## Conservation

<!-- Conserved quantities must be preserved. -->

## Dimensional Analysis

<!-- All outputs must have correct dimensions/units. -->

## Red Flags

<!-- Conditions that would indicate a clearly wrong answer. -->
